### Non-Functional Requirements (301 & 401 only)
### Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the application but still important to the app.

Examples include:

- Security
- Usability
- Testability
- etc….
- Pick 2 non-functional requirements and describe their functionality in your application.

If you are stuck on what non-functional requirements are, do a quick online search and do some research. Write a minimum of 3-5 sentences to describe how the non-functional requirements fits into your app.

You MUST describe what the non-functional requirement is and how it will be implemented. Simply saying “Our project will be testable for testibility” is NOT acceptable. Tell us how, why, and what.
